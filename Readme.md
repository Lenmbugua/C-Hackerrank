We're starting out by printing the most famous computing phrase of all time! In the editor below, use either printf or cout to print Hello,world! the string  to stdout.

The more popular command form is cout. It has the following basic form:

cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print;

Any number of values can be printed using one command as shown.

The printf command comes from C language. It accepts an optional format specification and a list of variables. Two examples for printing a string are:

printf("%s", string); printf(string);

Note that neither method adds a newline. It only prints what you tell it to.



This are just hackerrank questions on C++ for practice;

            one line that contains 3 space-separated integers: a,b,andc.
            print the sum of the three numbers on a single line.
